Description: IP::Country - fast lookup of country codes from IP addresses
 This module comes bundled with a database of countries where various IP addresses
 have been assigned. Although the country of assignment will probably be the
 country associated with a large ISP rather than the client herself, this is
 probably good enough for most log analysis applications, and under test has
 proved to be as accurate as reverse-DNS and WHOIS lookup.
