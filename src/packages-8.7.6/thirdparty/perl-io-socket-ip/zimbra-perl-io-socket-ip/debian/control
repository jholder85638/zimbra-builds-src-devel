Description: IO::Socket::IP - Family-neutral IP socket supporting both IPv4 and IPv6
 This module provides a protocol-independent way to use IPv4 and IPv6 sockets,
 intended as a replacement for IO::Socket::INET. Most constructor arguments
 and methods are provided in a backward-compatible way. For a list of known
 differences, see the IO::Socket::INET INCOMPATIBILITES section below.
