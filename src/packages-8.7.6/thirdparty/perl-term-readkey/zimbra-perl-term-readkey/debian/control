Description: Term::ReadKey - A perl module for simple terminal control
 Term::ReadKey is a compiled perl module dedicated to providing simple control
 over terminal driver modes (cbreak, raw, cooked, etc.,) support for non-blocking
 reads, if the architecture allows, and some generalized handy functions for
 working with terminals. One of the main goals is to have the functions as
 portable as possible, so you can just plug in "use Term::ReadKey" on any
 architecture and have a good likelihood of it working.
