Description: File::Grep - Find matches to a pattern in a series of files and related functions
 File::Grep provides similar functionality as perl's builtin grep, map,
 and foreach commands, but iterating over a passed filelist instead of
 arrays.  While trivial, this module can provide a quick dropin when
 such functionality is needed.
