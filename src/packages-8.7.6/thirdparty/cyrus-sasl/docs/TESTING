                  Testing the Zimbra Authentication Mechanism
                  -------------------------------------------

    The sasl configuration file for zimbra defaults to
    /opt/zimbra/cyrus-sasl/etc/saslauthd.conf -- this file contains the 
    configuration directives specified in the IMPLEMENTATION document

    saslauthd messages go into syslog. Check /var/log/messages for saslauthd
    messages, and adjust syslog.conf (see syslog.conf(5)) to display messages
    at level LOG_DEBUG

                                  Round-robin
                                  -----------

    If you have a development system of Zimbra, then your auth URL should look
    like http://localhost:7070/service/soap/ -- if you have a production 
    system, then just http://localhost/service/soap/

    If you have a multi-node install, specify all the URLs against zimbra_url
    in the saslauthd.conf as follows:

    zimbra_url: http://s1/service/soap/ http://s2/service/soap/ ...

    If you don't have a multi-node install, you can easily set up ssh port
    forwarding so that you can forward other TCP ports to port 80 (or 7070, if
    you have a development system), on localhost:

    $ ssh -g -L 8070:localhost:7070 you@localhost
    $ ssh -g -L 8071:localhost:7070 you@localhost

    This will cause SSH to forward local ports 8070 and 8071 to port 7070 on
    localhost, so that you can treat localhost:8070 and localhost:8071 as 
    identical representations of localhost:80, and so your zimbra_url can
    contain these urls:

    zimbra_url: http://localhost:7070/service/soap/ http://localhost:8071/service/soap/ http://localhost:8072/service/soap/

    Further, set the zimbra_connect_timeout, zimbra_timeout, and 
    zimbra_retry_interval to appropriate values. To test the failover, either
    specify a non-reachable URL in the zimbra_url list, or otherwise configure
    iptables and ip6tables to drop or reject connections to the legitimate 
    ports. 

                               Running saslauthd
                               -----------------

    (+) Typical invocation for saslauthd is:
            $ /opt/zimbra/cyrus-sasl/sbin/saslauthd -r -a zimbra

        which will cause saslauthd to start (by default) 5 worker processes

    (+) To start only a single worker process, use the -n switch:
            $ /opt/zimbra/cyrus-sasl/sbin/saslauthd -n 1 -r -a zimbra

    (+) To run in foreground mode, use the -d switch:
            $ /opt/zimbra/cyrus-sasl/sbin/saslauthd -d -n 1 -r -a zimbra

                               Testing saslauthd
                               -----------------

    You can test saslauthd by using the command line tool testsaslauthd:
    $ /usr/sbin/testsaslauthd -s zimbra -f /opt/zimbra/cyrus-sasl/state/mux \
      -u user1@my-domain.com -p test123

    See /var/log/messages for details, notice the debug messages when zimbra
    auth fails over to next available URL

    Also note that if `n' URLs are present in the list, then at best, only
    one URL will be used in order to authenticate (in case the URL is 
    reachable without any error), whereas in the worst case, where no URL is
    reachable, no more than `n' URLs will be attempted before zimbra 
    authentication gives up and reports an error

                                      ***
