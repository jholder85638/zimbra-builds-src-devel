Description: Error - Error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 The Error package provides two interfaces. Firstly Error provides
 a procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly Error is a
 base class for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for
 subsequent catch, or can simply be recorded.
