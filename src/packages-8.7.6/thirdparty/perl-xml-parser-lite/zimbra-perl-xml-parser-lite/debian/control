Description: XML::Parser::Lite - Lightweight pure-perl XML Parser (based on regexps)
 This module implements an XML parser with a interface similar to XML::Parser.
 Though not all callbacks are supported, you should be able to use it in the same
 way you use XML::Parser. Due to using experimental regexp features it'll work only
 on Perl 5.6 and above and may behave differently on different platforms.
