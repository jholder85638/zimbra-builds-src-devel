Description: Class::Inspector - Get information about a class and its structure
 Class::Inspector allows you to get information about a loaded class. Most or all of
 this information can be found in other ways, but they aren't always very friendly,
 and usually involve a relatively high level of Perl wizardry, or strange and unusual
 looking code. Class::Inspector attempts to provide an easier, more friendly interface
 to this information.
