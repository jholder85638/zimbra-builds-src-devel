Description: an extensible, generic Perl server engine
 Net::Server attempts to be a generic server as in Net::Daemon and
 NetServer::Generic. It includes with it the ability to run as an
 inetd process (Net::Server::INET), a single connection server
 (Net::Server or Net::Server::Single), a forking server
 (Net::Server::Fork), a preforking server which maintains a constant
 number of preforked children (Net::Server::PreForkSimple), or as a
 managed preforking server which maintains the number of children
 based on server load (Net::Server::PreFork).
