Description: Mail::SPF - An object-oriented implementation of Sender Policy Framework
 Mail::SPF is an object-oriented implementation of Sender Policy Framework (SPF).
 See http://www.openspf.org for more information about SPF.
 This class collection aims to fully conform to the SPF specification (RFC 4408)
 so as to serve both as a production quality SPF implementation and as a reference
 for other developers of SPF implementations.
