Description: Net::DNS::Resolver::Programmable - programmable DNS resolver class for offline emulation of DNS
 Net::DNS::Resolver::Programmable is a Net::DNS::Resolver descendant class that
 allows a virtual DNS to be emulated instead of querying the real DNS.  A set
 of static DNS records may be supplied, or arbitrary code may be specified as a
 means for retrieving DNS records, or even generating them on the fly.
