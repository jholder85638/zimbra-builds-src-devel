Description: XML::SAX - Simple API for XML
 XML::SAX consists of several framework classes for using and building
 Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers. It is designed around the
 need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an application
 without requiring programmer intervention. Those of you familiar with
 the DBI will be right at home. Some of the designs come from the Java
 JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the javaness.
