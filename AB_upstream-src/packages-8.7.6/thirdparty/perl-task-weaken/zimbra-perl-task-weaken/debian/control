Description: Task::Weaken - Ensure that a platform has weaken support
 One recurring problem in modules that use Scalar::Util's weaken function
 is that it is not present in the pure-perl variant.
 While this isn't necesarily always a problem in a straight CPAN-based
 Perl environment, some operating system distributions only include the
 pure-Perl versions, don't include the XS version, and so weaken is then
 "missing" from the platform, despite passing a dependency on Scalar::Util
 successfully.
