Description: Digest::HMAC - Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication
 HMAC is used for message integrity checks between two parties that
 share a secret key, and works in combination with some other Digest
 algorithm, usually MD5 or SHA-1.  The HMAC mechanism is described in
 RFC 2104.
 .
 The Digest::HMAC module follow the common Digest:: interface, but the
 constructor takes the secret key and the name of some other simple
 Digest:: module as argument.
