Description: DB_File - Perl5 access to Berkeley DB version 1.x
 DB_File is a module which allows Perl programs to make use of the facilities
 provided by Berkeley DB version 1.x (if you have a newer version of DB, see
 "Using DB_File with Berkeley DB version 2 or greater"). It is assumed that you
 have a copy of the Berkeley DB manual pages at hand when reading this documentation.
 The interface defined here mirrors the Berkeley DB interface closely.
