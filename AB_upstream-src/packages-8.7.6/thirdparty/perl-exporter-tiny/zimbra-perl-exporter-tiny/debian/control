Description: Exporter::Tiny - an exporter with the features of Sub::Exporter but only core dependencies
 Exporter::Tiny supports many of Sub::Exporter's external-facing features
 including renaming imported functions with the '-as', '-prefix' and
 '-suffix' options; explicit destinations with the 'into' option; and
 alternative installers with the 'installer' option. But it's written in
 only about 40% as many lines of code and with zero non-core dependencies.
