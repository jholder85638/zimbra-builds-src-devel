Description: NetAddr::IP - Manages IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and subnets
 This module provides an object-oriented abstraction on top of IP
 addresses or IP subnets that allows for easy manipulations.
 Version 4.xx of NetAddr::IP will work with older versions of Perl
 and is compatible with Math::BigInt.
