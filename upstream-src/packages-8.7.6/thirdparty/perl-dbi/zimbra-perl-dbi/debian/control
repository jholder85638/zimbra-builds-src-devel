Description: DBI - The Perl Database Interface
 The DBI is a database access module for the Perl programming
 language. It defines a set of methods, variables, and
 onventions that provide a consistent database interface,
 independent of the actual database being used.
 It is important to remember that the DBI is just an interface.
 The DBI is a layer of "glue" between an application and one or
 more database driver modules. It is the driver modules which do
 most of the real work. The DBI provides a standard interface
 and framework for the drivers to operate within.
