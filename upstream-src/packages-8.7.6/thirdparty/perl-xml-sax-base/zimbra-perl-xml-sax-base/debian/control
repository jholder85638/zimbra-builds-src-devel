Description: XML::SAX::Base - Base class SAX Drivers and Filters
 This module has a very simple task - to be a base class for PerlSAX drivers
 and filters. It's default behaviour is to pass the input directly to the
 output unchanged. It can be useful to use this module as a base class so
 you don't have to, for example, implement the characters() callback.
