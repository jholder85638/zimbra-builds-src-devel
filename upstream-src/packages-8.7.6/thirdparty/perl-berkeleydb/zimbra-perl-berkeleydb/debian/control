Description: BerkeleyDB - Perl extension for Berkeley DB version 2, 3, 4 or 5
 This Perl module provides an interface to most of the functionality available
 in Berkeley DB versions 2, 3, 5 and 6. In general it is safe to assume that
 the interface provided here to be identical to the Berkeley DB interface. The
 main changes have been to make the Berkeley DB API work in a Perl way. Note
 that if you are using Berkeley DB 2.x, the new features available in Berkeley
 DB 3.x or later are not available via this module.
