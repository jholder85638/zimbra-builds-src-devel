Description: Carp::Clan - Report errors from perspective of caller of a "clan" of modules
 This module reports errors from the perspective of the caller of a
 "clan" of modules, similar to "Carp.pm" itself. But instead of giving
 it a number of levels to skip on the calling stack, you give it a
 pattern to characterize the package names of the "clan" of modules
 which shall never be blamed for any error.
